We support popular image formats (JPEG, JPG, PNG) and provide instant previews so you know exactly how your image will look before sharing.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Image Storage:</strong> Your images are securely stored using ImgBB's reliable cloud storage service, ensuring fast loading times and 99.9% uptime. This means your photos are always accessible and load quickly for viewers around the world.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Your privacy and data security are our top priorities. We want to be completely transparent about how we handle your email address and personal information:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> We collect your email address solely for account creation and authentication purposes.
